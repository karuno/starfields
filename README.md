# Starfield
This was created by Carson (Karuno). Credit to xcase for giving me the code for the scroll slow down + change directions.
You can put text, images and much more.
Functions:
Scroll up and down to change the direction and speed of the starfield.
Click for the stars to lengthen and last longer while moving the stars in air.
Move your cursor around the webpage area for the stars to follow it.
Drag and move your cursor for the stars to lengthen and follow the cursor at the same time.
Please don't try to add any extra things like a navbar, it will just break the webpage.
